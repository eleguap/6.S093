# 6.S093 – How to Ship Almost Anything with AI (IAP 2026)

### MIT IAP 2026 · Jan 20–27
**Units:** 6 · **Level:** Undergraduate · **Grading:** P/F

This repository contains my work for [_**6.S093: How to Ship Almost Anything with AI v2**_](https://iap.sundai.club), an MIT IAP course focused on building end-to-end autonomous AI systems.

### Course Overview

The goal of the class is to learn how to design, build, and deploy agentic AI systems that can operate autonomously. The central project is a fully autonomous AI agent that manages social media for a company or individual using a “second brain” knowledge base.

The course emphasizes rapid prototyping, real deployments, and hands-on experience with modern AI tooling.

### What I’m Building

By the end of the course, this project aims to include:

- An autonomous AI agent that:

    - Monitors a knowledge base (Notion / Obsidian / text files)

    - Generates and posts social media content

    - Creates custom images using diffusion models

    - Scrapes and engages with relevant online content

- (Optional features)

    -   Human-in-the-loop approval via Telegram

    - Web dashboard for monitoring and control

### Topics Covered

- Agentic system design & tool calling

- Multimodal LLMs and image generation

- RAG and semantic search for memory

- Web scraping and social media APIs

- Cloud deployment

- AI-powered developer workflows

### Tech Stack (varies by implementation)

- Python

- LLM APIs (OpenAI / Anthropic / OpenRouter, etc.)

- Pydantic for structured tool calling

- Playwright for scraping

- SQLite / vector databases for memory

- Cloud deployment (GCP)

- (Optional) Next.js / Tailwind for frontend

### Motivation

Inspired by the idea of the “one-person unicorn” — using agentic AI to build and ship full-stack products as a solo developer.

This repo is both a learning log and a working system.
